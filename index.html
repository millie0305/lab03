        <h2>Concept and creation</h2>
        <p>Isabelle, known as Shizue (しずえ) in Japan, is a fictional character from the Animal Crossing series of video games. 
          She is a gentle Shih Tzu that debuted in the 2012 release Animal Crossing: New Leaf,
          where she serves as the secretary to the player character.</p>

        <p> Isabelle is a golden-coloured Shih Tzu, originally named Shizue in Japanese.
          The development team of New Leaf created her after deciding that the player-controlled mayor needed an assistant.
          They focused on making a "very affectionate" character who was loyal and helpful,
          and thus chose to make a female dog who was "a little bit clumsy... but still very cute". 
          Animal Crossing designers wanted players to reject Isabelle's offer of a ceremony for various accomplishments as mayor at least once
          so that they feel bad about having done so. Animal Crossing director Katsuya Eguchi and New Leaf producer Aya Kyogoku both enjoyed Isabelle;
          Eguchi appreciated her for her smile, friendliness, and clumsiness.
        </p>
        <p> Isabelle's appearance in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is based on fellow Animal Crossing character Villager.
          However, Super Smash Bros. series director Masahiro Sakurai chose not to make Isabelle an "Echo Fighter" (a character with relatively minor
          differences from another) of Villager because of her different animations and her proportions being based on character models in Animal Crossing: New Leaf,
          as opposed to earlier Animal Crossing character models.
